# fewd-7-interactive-video-player
Messing around with HTML 5 video player!

I should've use Sass for this, but I only thought about it when I'm almost finish with the project. Maybe next one!
Tested in: 
Safari Version 9.1.1 (10601.6.17), Chrome Version 50.0.2661.102 (64-bit) and Firefox Version 46.0.1

Time taken: About 1.5 weeks or so. Was a little stuck in the "highlight the caption as the video plays" part.
